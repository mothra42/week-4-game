Need a character object. 

each character object should have the following properties:
HP,Attack,counter attack, image(maybe)

I need a function that does the attacking. 
that function should take in an attack value, counter attack value, and health for both characters involved
it will calculate the proper steps

I need another function designed to level up the player's attack power. (potentially a nested function.)

I need click events for each character and the attack button. those click events need to be context sensitive to what the player intends for them to do.
